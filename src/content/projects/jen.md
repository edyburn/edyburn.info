Developed a commercial web application, using Django, which allowed teachers to
easily create accessible web pages with multiple difficulty levels, Jen: The
Tiered Web Page Generator<!--http://www.tieredwebpages.com -->. The generated
pages included text resizing, color theme, text to speech, and translation
controls for students to personalize their learning experience. WYSIWYG text
editing was provided for users using CKEditor.
